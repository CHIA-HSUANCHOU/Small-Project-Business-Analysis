## Project Description:
### **Airline Passenger Satisfaction**
1. Predict passenger satisfaction.
Choose a supervised learning method to predict passenger satisfaction. Identify the factors that are highly correlated with a satisfied (or dissatisfied) passenger.

2. Customer segmentation
Choose one unsupervised method to divide customers into groups based on common characteristics so companies can market to each group effectively and appropriately.

### **Analysis of financial indexes**
Analyze financial statements to understand company characteristics. Use dimensionality reduction techniques to identify meaningful indicators for evaluating high-performing companies.

1. Use PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or SPCA (Sparse PCA) to determine how much variance each principal component explains. Estimate how many principal components are needed to explain the dataset.

2. Identify the key variables for the top three principal components and explain their significance.

3. Identify companies suitable for investment. (There is no need to specify which companies, just explain based on the first principal component. For example, companies with a high return on assets may be good investment choices.)

### **A/B test**
The company has developed a new web page to try and increase the number of users who “convert,” meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company’s product.

### **Word Cloud**
Text mining: 2022 Feature Films’ Satisfaction With The Reviews
Choose a 2022 feature film and use text mining techniques to analyze the reviews. Generate a word cloud and summarize the sentiment expressed in the reviews.
